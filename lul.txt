I think American news is pretty tragic in general. You get a new one. I get sick of myself, so I can imagine how everyone else feels. I relate to these characters because aspects of their personality are like me. Anything by Disney makes me cry.

You tell me where we start, where we're going, where we're going afterwards. You just tell me what you want, and I'm gonna be that for you. For example, the sun goes up and then it goes down. I could be pensive, uhh... smart, supersticious, brave? And I, uhh, I can be light on my feet. It's nice to be around people that have a sense of the world around them, that are, in general, more conscious and conscientious.
